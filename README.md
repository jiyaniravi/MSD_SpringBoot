# MSD_SpringBoot
This is the same MyShipmentDelivery project created back in year 2015 in PHP. But this time it is with use of Spring Boot.

# Few considerations during development will be 

* TDD approch will is used (Used spock to write integration/unit test)
* Spring Boot is used as backend framework
* Angular 8+ will be used for frontend framework
* Jest will might be used for UT of client side scripting
* Using already existing MySQL DB
* Gradle is used as build tool

# Purpose of this Project

* To learn TDD approch and levarage features of Spring Boot and Angular
* To migrate existing PHP project to Java
